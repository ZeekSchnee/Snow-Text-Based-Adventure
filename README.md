# Snow-Text-Based-Adventure
I'm learning Python and am starting with a little personal project where I make a small text based RPG.
The goal of this project is to develope a small text-based RPG with 3 sections.
- An open explorable area, where you can choose what to interact with and perform actions upon
- A dialogue section where you can talk with an NPC
- Finally, a battle section where you fight a monster

---

In doing this, my philosophy is to build a framework so that any number of locations, NPCs, and battles can be interacted with.
